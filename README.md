## Discord Bots


### GitLab Webhook for Discord
Similar to Discord's built-in support for GitHub webhooks, this is a custom implementation using the [GitLab webhook API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html) and [DiscordJS](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/).  May be extended later to support Twitter webhooks as well.

- [Discord Test Server](https://discord.gg/tZWqhWd)
- [GitLab Test Project](https://gitlab.com/Warped2713/test-discord-webhook/issues)
- Add the GitLab Webhook bot to your Discord Server (coming soon!)

### Mr. Prog
Mr.Prog is an interactive chat bot that enables members of your Discord server to create, customize, and interact with their own personal NetNavi.  While originally intended to be for fans of the Mega Man Battle Network series, it could easily be modified for use with any kind of characters.  Members can customize the appearance and personality of their partner character, and even make their character say things on command or in specific contexts.
